# Predictive Analysis of Hospital Resource Utilization During the COVID-19 Pandemic

In this project, I focused on the Hospital Capacity Needs Prediction for COVID-19 patients, utilizing machine learning to forecast the demand for hospital beds. This predictive model aimed to assist in hospital resource planning by estimating the required bed capacity during peak demand periods.

I applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while preserving important information from the dataset. For predictive modeling, I used Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to forecast hospital bed requirements based on the Ministry of Health Malaysia's public COVID-19 dataset. To ensure the robustness of the models, I also implemented K-fold cross-validation to validate the model performance and minimize overfitting.

The predictions from this model provided valuable insights into bed demand, enabling hospitals to plan and allocate resources more effectively, ensuring they could handle surges in COVID-19 patients without overloading capacity.
